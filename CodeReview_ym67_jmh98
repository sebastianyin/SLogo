Mike’s code:
In MathCommandFactory, consolidate args length checking and put them in the front
Separate commands into different classes







Jasper’s code:

UIView class from Cell Society:

-separating back and front end was good in this class
-Should have used a resource file for strings associated with buttons
-should have passed button events as lambda expression parameters when creating buttons
-should not have had class variables, should have passed through methods as parameters instead
